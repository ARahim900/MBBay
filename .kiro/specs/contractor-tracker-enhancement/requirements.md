# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the contractor tracker section by implementing secure Supabase database integration and redesigning the layout to maintain visual consistency with other application modules (firefighting, alarm, water, etc.). The enhancement will replace the current static data implementation with dynamic database connectivity while standardizing all UI components including color schemes, typography, spacing, and navigation patterns to match the unified design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want the contractor tracker to connect securely to the Supabase database, so that I can access real-time contractor data and manage contracts dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contractor tracker loads THEN it SHALL fetch data from the Supabase contractor_tracker table using the provided REST API endpoint
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL include the required headers (apikey and Authorization with Bearer token)
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback to cached data if available
4. WHEN data is successfully fetched THEN it SHALL display all contractor information including id, contractor_name, service_provided, status, contract_type, start_date, end_date, contract_monthly_amount, contract_yearly_amount, notes, created_at, and updated_at
5. WHEN filtering by status THEN the system SHALL use the active contractors endpoint (status=eq.Active) for performance optimization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want to view analytics and summary data for contractor management, so that I can make informed decisions about contract renewals and service management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the contractor dashboard THEN it SHALL display data from the contractor_tracker_summary analytics view
2. WHEN checking contract expirations THEN it SHALL fetch and display data from the contracts_expiring_soon view
3. WHEN analyzing service distribution THEN it SHALL show data from the contracts_by_service view
4. WHEN displaying KPI metrics THEN it SHALL calculate and show total contracts, active contracts, expiring contracts, and total contract value
5. WHEN viewing contract trends THEN it SHALL provide visual indicators for contract status changes and upcoming renewals

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the contractor tracker to visually match the rest of the application, so that I have a consistent and professional experience across all modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the contractor tracker dashboard THEN the color scheme SHALL match the application's theme colors (primary: #2D9CDB, secondary: #FF5B5B, accent: #F7C604)
2. WHEN viewing any contractor component THEN the typography SHALL use the Inter font family with consistent sizing (title: 1.25rem, label: 0.875rem, tooltip: 0.75rem)
3. WHEN interacting with contractor UI elements THEN they SHALL use the same Card, KpiCard, and Button components as other modules
4. WHEN viewing the contractor navigation THEN it SHALL use the same MenuBar component with consistent gradient backgrounds and iconColor patterns
5. WHEN viewing the contractor header THEN it SHALL follow the same layout pattern as FirefightingDashboard and other enhanced modules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the contractor components to follow the same visual hierarchy and spacing patterns, so that the interface feels familiar and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing contractor cards THEN they SHALL use the standard Card component with consistent padding, border radius, and shadow styles
2. WHEN viewing KPI metrics THEN they SHALL use the KpiCard component with the established color mapping (green, blue, orange, pink, etc.)
3. WHEN viewing buttons THEN they SHALL use the Button component with consistent variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, danger)
4. WHEN viewing the dashboard layout THEN it SHALL follow the same grid patterns and spacing as other enhanced modules
5. WHEN viewing data tables THEN they SHALL use consistent styling with proper hover effects and responsive design

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the contractor components to use the centralized theme configuration, so that design changes can be managed consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing contractor components THEN they SHALL import and use colors from the theme.ts configuration
2. WHEN styling contractor elements THEN they SHALL use the theme's typography, spacing, and borderRadius values
3. WHEN creating new contractor components THEN they SHALL follow the same component structure and prop patterns as existing UI components
4. WHEN applying hover effects and animations THEN they SHALL use the theme's animation duration and easing values
5. WHEN handling theme values THEN they SHALL use the getThemeValue() utility function with proper fallbacks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want to perform CRUD operations on contractor data, so that I can maintain accurate and up-to-date contract information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new contractor THEN the system SHALL POST data to the Supabase contractor_tracker table with all required fields
2. WHEN updating contractor information THEN the system SHALL PATCH the specific record with changed fields only
3. WHEN deleting a contractor THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and DELETE the record from the database
4. WHEN performing any CRUD operation THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and display appropriate success/error messages
5. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL refresh the local state and update the UI immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want to filter and search contractor data efficiently, so that I can quickly find specific contracts or services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for contractors THEN the system SHALL filter by contractor name, service provided, and notes fields
2. WHEN filtering by status THEN the system SHALL show Active, Expired, or All contracts as selected
3. WHEN filtering by contract type THEN the system SHALL distinguish between Contract and PO types
4. WHEN filtering by date ranges THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by start date, end date, or expiration periods
5. WHEN applying multiple filters THEN the system SHALL combine filters using AND logic and update results in real-time

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want to receive notifications about contract expirations, so that I can proactively manage contract renewals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contracts are nearing expiration THEN the system SHALL highlight them using warning colors from the theme (status.warning: #f59e0b)
2. WHEN viewing expired contracts THEN they SHALL be displayed with error colors from the theme (status.error: #ef4444)
3. WHEN contracts are active and current THEN they SHALL use success colors from the theme (status.success: #10b981)
4. WHEN displaying contract status badges THEN they SHALL use consistent styling with proper contrast ratios
5. WHEN showing expiration warnings THEN the system SHALL calculate days until expiration and display appropriate urgency indicators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the contractor tracker to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt to smaller screens with proper touch targets
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via tab navigation
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all content SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
4. WHEN viewing in dark mode THEN all components SHALL use the appropriate dark theme colors
5. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN the layout SHALL respond smoothly without breaking or overlapping content

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the contractor tracker to handle errors gracefully and maintain data security, so that the system remains stable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL cache data locally and sync when connection is restored
3. WHEN handling sensitive contract data THEN all API communications SHALL use HTTPS and proper authentication
4. WHEN storing temporary data THEN it SHALL be encrypted and cleared appropriately
5. WHEN logging errors THEN sensitive information SHALL be excluded from logs and error reports
