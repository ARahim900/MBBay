## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Global CSS override file at `src/overrides.css` to enforce navigation styling with high-specificity selectors and `!important` for reliability across variants and themes.
- Data attributes on `Navigation` component (`data-mb-nav`, `data-mb-nav-item`, `data-active`, `data-variant`, `data-orientation`) to enable precise, non-invasive styling overrides.
- Wired overrides via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/overrides.css" />` in `index.html` to ensure early load and Netlify-friendly deployment.

### Notes
- Overrides intentionally use `!important` to guarantee they take precedence over utility classes.
