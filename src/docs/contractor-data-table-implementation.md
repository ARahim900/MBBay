# Contractor Data Table Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 6: "Implement enhanced contractor data table" from the contractor tracker enhancement specification. The task has been successfully completed with all required features and theme consistency.

## Implemented Components

### 1. StatusBadge Component (`src/components/ui/StatusBadge.tsx`)

A reusable status badge component with theme-consistent colors:

**Features:**
- Supports all contractor status types: Active, Expired, Pending
- Theme-consistent colors using `getThemeValue()` utility
- Dark mode support
- Visual status indicators with colored dots
- Proper typography and spacing

**Color Mapping:**
- Active: Green (`theme.colors.status.success`)
- Expired: Red (`theme.colors.status.error`) 
- Pending: Yellow (`theme.colors.status.warning`)

### 2. ContractorDataTable Component (`src/components/contractor/ContractorDataTable.tsx`)

A comprehensive data table component with advanced features:

**Core Features:**
- ✅ Responsive design with standardized Card container
- ✅ Theme-consistent styling using `getThemeValue()` utility
- ✅ Loading states with skeleton animation
- ✅ Empty state handling
- ✅ Error boundary support

**Filtering & Search:**
- ✅ Real-time search across contractor name, service, and notes
- ✅ Status filter (All, Active, Expired, Pending)
- ✅ Contract type filter (All, Contract, PO)
- ✅ Combined filter logic with AND operations

**Sorting:**
- ✅ Sortable columns: Contractor Name, Service, Contract Type, End Date, Annual Value
- ✅ Ascending/descending sort with visual indicators
- ✅ Proper handling of different data types (strings, numbers, dates)
- ✅ Null value handling

**Pagination:**
- ✅ Configurable page size (default: 10 items)
- ✅ Page navigation controls
- ✅ Results summary with filtering context
- ✅ Automatic page reset on filter changes

**Data Display:**
- ✅ Formatted currency display (OMR format with thousands separators)
- ✅ Formatted date display (DD/MM/YYYY format)
- ✅ StatusBadge integration for consistent status display
- ✅ Truncated text with tooltips for long content
- ✅ Icon integration for visual context

**Actions:**
- ✅ View, Edit, Delete action buttons
- ✅ Export functionality
- ✅ Proper event handling with contractor data

## Integration with ContractorTrackerDashboard

The enhanced data table has been integrated into the main contractor dashboard:

**Changes Made:**
1. Added import for `ContractorDataTable` component
2. Added import for `StatusBadge` component
3. Replaced the "Contractors" sub-module placeholder with the full data table
4. Updated the dashboard preview table to use `StatusBadge` for consistency
5. Connected all data table actions to placeholder handlers

**Navigation Integration:**
- The data table is accessible via the "Contractors" tab in the MenuBar
- Maintains the same visual hierarchy as other enhanced modules
- Consistent header styling and spacing

## Theme Consistency Validation

The implementation follows all theme consistency requirements:

**Colors:**
- ✅ Uses `getThemeValue()` for all color values
- ✅ Proper fallback values for all theme colors
- ✅ Consistent status color mapping
- ✅ Dark mode support throughout

**Typography:**
- ✅ Inter font family usage
- ✅ Consistent font sizes (title: 1.25rem, label: 0.875rem, tooltip: 0.75rem)
- ✅ Proper font weights and line heights

**Spacing & Layout:**
- ✅ Consistent padding and margins
- ✅ Proper grid layouts and responsive design
- ✅ Card component usage for containers

**Components:**
- ✅ Uses standardized UI components (Card, Button)
- ✅ Consistent hover effects and animations
- ✅ Proper focus states and accessibility

## Requirements Compliance

The implementation satisfies all specified requirements:

**Requirement 4.4 & 4.5 (Visual Hierarchy & Spacing):**
- ✅ Uses standard Card component with consistent padding and styling
- ✅ Follows same grid patterns as other enhanced modules
- ✅ Consistent button variants and styling

**Requirement 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 (Filtering & Search):**
- ✅ Real-time search by contractor name, service, and notes
- ✅ Status filtering (Active/Expired/All)
- ✅ Contract type filtering
- ✅ Combined filter logic with real-time updates

**Requirement 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 (Status Indicators):**
- ✅ StatusBadge component with theme-consistent colors
- ✅ Proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- ✅ Visual status indicators with colored dots
- ✅ Consistent styling across all status types

**Requirement 9.1, 9.5 (Responsive Design):**
- ✅ Mobile-responsive layout with proper breakpoints
- ✅ Touch-friendly targets and spacing
- ✅ Responsive table with horizontal scrolling
- ✅ Adaptive filter layout for smaller screens
